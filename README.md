A ~~bad~~ attempt at writing a discord bot using discord.js

## How to deploy

1. Install node.js following instructions for your operating system
2. Clone the code from the repository
3. Run `npm install` in the cloned folder
4. Create a file called `config.json` and put your token inside of it. (Example will be below.)
5. Run `npm start` and the bot should start.

## Example `config.json`

```json
{
  "token": "a very secret token yessss"
}
```
